# Multi Aspects

The purpose behind this solution is to look at producing an example that demonstrates creating multiple Aspect libraries and having those libraries reuse common code.  When complete it should also demonstarate how the ordering of Aspects in a project affects the code that is eventually compiled.

The overall idea is to encourage potential authors of Metalama based aspects to think , from the outset, about what it is that they are creating and how and indeed whether chunks of what they are doing should be created in serarate reuseable libraries.

The priciple is to encourage the paradigm of clean Code.
